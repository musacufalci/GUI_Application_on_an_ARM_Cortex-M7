The GUI development is speed-up with the use of the Embedded Wizardâ€™s WYSIWYG editing facility, instant prototyping, simulating and debugging on PC without compiling, linking and flashing to the target MCU. The Embedded Wizard generates pure ANSI-C source code with no further dependencies on any other software stacks or components. The created GUI runs on bare metal or with any RTOS (real-time operating system).
