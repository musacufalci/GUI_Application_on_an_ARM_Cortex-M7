# GUI_Application_on_an_STM32F7
- Microcontroller:  STM32F7 series of very high-performance MCUs with Arm® Cortex®-M7 core
- 3rdParty-Components:
1. STM Source code
2. Gnu Make - GNU General Public License v2 or later
3. Gnu GCC - GNU General Public License v2 or later

- The work of the project: https://youtu.be/u_DeV4EHyiI

- Our Demo running on STM32F746 Discovery Board
Embedded Wizard lets you create GUIs that easily adopt the User Experience of smartphones with astonishing fast animations, gorgeous graphics and smart effects. See for yourself and watch this video with our demo on an STM32F746 discovery board.

- Templates:	The Templates window has been enhanced by a new Search... edit field. Now, the user can specify a filter to search within the complete Gallery.
 
- The GUI development is speed-up with the use of the Embedded Wizard’s WYSIWYG editing facility, instant prototyping, simulating and debugging on PC without compiling, linking and flashing to the target MCU.
The Embedded Wizard generates pure ANSI-C source code with no further dependencies on any other software stacks or components. The created GUI runs on bare metal or with any RTOS (real-time operating system).
